Those of you that want to know the order of processing for PHPMailer-FE:

* note: discusses only major functionality

- PHPMailer-FE gets handed the form data
- checks if the form is handing the data as $_GET or $_POST
  if ANY $_GETS found, PHPMailer-FE aborts.
- gets the IP address and Remote Host of the browser sending the form data
- displays the processing image
- converts all $_POST data as regular PHP variables
- reads and converts 'default.config.php' (converts all $_POST
  data as regular PHP variables ... overwrites any previous duplicates)
- CONDITIONAL:
  if getenv('HTTP_REFERER') is not blank OR $_POST['referer'] is set:
  - reads and converts the form config file (converts all $_POST
    data as regular PHP variables ... overwrites any previous duplicates)
- processes the Turing test
- checks if set 'referers' and if the form data submitted is in approved 'referers' ...
  will exit if not found in list
- checks email banlist ... will exit if the email address filled in the form is found
- checks IP/Remote Host banlist ... will exit if the IP address or Remote Host is found
- processes "required" fields
- processes file uploads (note: will check for errors and include a field in the email
  to the recipient if any errors are found)
- processes local file attachments
- parses the form data
- builds the environment report
- builds and sends the email(s)
- sends a copy to the $_POST['email'] if that field is available and the field
  send_email_copy is set
- sends the email reply on success (if successful) and uses the template file found
  in $_POST['replyEmailOnSuccess']
- processes 'default.plugin.php' (NOTE: there should be NO echo or print statements
  if the default.plugin.php if this is a Flash form or the Flash form will not receive
  the appropriate return code)
- processes the form specific plugin (NOTE: there should be NO echo or print statements
  if the default.plugin.php if this is a Flash form or the Flash form will not receive
  the appropriate return code)
- exits if this is a flash form
- redirects to Thank You for your submission page (either generated page or redirects
  based on $_POST['redirect'])
