PHPMailer-FE = PHPMailer Formmail Edition.

1. Unzip

2. Edit the file phpmailer-fe.php. The script is well commented.
   There are a number of settings that you will want to set as a
   bare minimum.

   - The first requires a decision from you. This script features
   the ability to track the IP address and Remote Host of browsers
   that attempt to use your form to send you spam. The way it works
   is that the script will look at any fields that contain the
   word "url" in the field name. If that field contains ANY
   url, the entire submission will be classified as spam and
   the user submitting the form will be banned from ever submitting
   forms through this script again (on your site).
   It's easy for you to use this feature and by-pass it if you want
   people to submit URLs through your forms (just done use "url"
   as part of the field name).
   The default is false, meaning this features will NOT be used.
   If you enable this feature (set to true), you will also need to
   ensure that the file 'banlog.php' is writable.

   - If you plan on using PHPMailer or PHPMailer-Lite as the transport
   for your emails,set the variable:
   $PHPMailerLocation = "class.phpmailer.php";
   to the full location of your PHPMailer script. You need to put
   class.phpmailer.php in the same directory as phpmailer-fe.php.
   (note: download class.phpmailer.php from 
   http://phpmailer.worxware.com/index.php?pg=sf&p=dl )
   - OR -    $PHPMailerLiteLocation = "class.phpmailer-lite.php";
   to the full location of your PHPMailer Lite script. You need to put
   class.phpmailer-lite.php in the same directory as phpmailer-fe.php.
   (note: download class.phpmailer-lite.php from 
    http://phpmailer.worxware.com/index.php?pg=sf&p=dl )

   - This script looks for a field name "recipient" as the email
   address to send the form output to. You can set that in your form
   (that does pose a risk, though, since the email address then
   becomes accessible to email robots). A better option is to go to
   change the script:

   if (!$recipient) {
     $recipient = 'codeworxtech@users.sourceforge.net';
   } else {
     $recipient = eregi_replace($email_bad_array,'',$recipient);
     $recipient = str_replace(" ", "", $recipient);
   }

   to:

   $recipient = "webmaster@mydomain.com";
   (deleted three lines)
   and set the email address to your choice.

   - A new feature introduced in version 4.0.5 is the ability to 
   restrict users from pressing the page refresh button on their 
   browser and submitting the form data multiple times. In
   phpmailer-fe.php, change this line:
   $stopRefresh    = false; //true;
   to 
   $stopRefresh    = true;

   -- those are the important ones ... however, take a few minutes
   to read through the script. It is well commented and fairly easy
   to figure out.

2. Once you have the settings the way you want them, copy all the files
   to your webserver. Example:
   /formsout

3. Setup your forms to use PHPMailer-FE as the "action". Example:
   <form method="post" action="formsout/phpmailer-fe.php">

   * see sample_form/form.html for a working example

*  note: if you are using any of the extended features of phpmailer-fe.php
   please use a hidden field to include the name of the form. Example:
   <input type="hidden" value="form.html" name="referer">
   - the purpose of this is that $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'] is not reliable and 
     referer is required

That is all it takes to protect your inbox from spammers that capitalize on
your website contact forms to gather email addresses and user feedback.

A quick note on Turing test or "captcha" utilities. There is a Turing
test (or captcha utility) included with PHPMailer-FE. It is a server
side solution ... that means that the validation does not occur until
after your customer has submitted the data. If you want to use the
Turing test, insert this in your form:
<img src="worxturing.php"><br />
Enter security code:<br />
<input name="WorxTuringTest" id="WorxTuringTest"><br />
PHPMailer-FE is set to use that form name (WorxTuringTest) to validate
the user's input.

Enjoy!
